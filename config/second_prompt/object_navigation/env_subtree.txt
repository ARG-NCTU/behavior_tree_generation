Imagine you are helping me interact with the Gazebo simulator for drones. 

There is an object detection model on using the images from the front facing camera. It will return two variables:
obj_list: Which is a list of the names of objects detected in the scene.
obj_locs: A list of bounding box coordinates in the image for each object

The following subtrees are available. You are not to use any other hypothetical functions.And not all subtrees are suitable and necessary, you need to evaluate and choose the subtrees you need.

Subtrees:
"object_in_view": This behavior tree will return true when there is desired object in sight. 
"object_not_in_view": This behavior tree will return true when there is no object in sight.
"reset_drone": When this subtree is triggered, reset the preflight state that need to reset before takeoff.
"waypoint_takeoff": When this subtree is triggered, takeoff to the air.
"waypoint_landing": When this subtree is triggered, land to the ground immediately.
"waypoint_tracking": When this subtree is triggered, move toward the target object position when the target object is inside the camera view.
"linear_x_control": When this subtree is triggered, try to minimize the absolute(drone_x - object_x) when the target object is inside the camera view.
"linear_y_control": When this subtree is triggered, try to minimize the absolute(drone_y - object_y) when the target object is inside the camera view.
"linear_z_control": When this subtree is triggered, try to minimize the absolute(drone_z - object_z) when the target object is inside the camera view.
"report_error": When this subtree is triggered, report current distance (distance = (drone_x - object_X)^2 + (drone_y - object_y)^2 + (drone_z - object_z)^2)^0.5) , and the supervisor will evaulate the performance according to this distance.
"explore_forward": When this subtree is triggered, move forward a static distance.
"rotate_right": When this subtree is triggered, Rotate 90 degree to right side and raise the flag. If the flag is not been reset, this subtree will not been triggered.
"rotate_left": When this subtree is triggered, Rotate 90 degree to left side and raise the flag. If the flag is not been reset, this subtree will not been triggered.
"explore_rotate": When this subtree is triggered, rotate to left side and right side one time and raise the flag. If the flag is not been reset, this subtree will not been triggered.
"explore_pattern_block": When this subtree is triggered, follow the pattern block pattern to explore a huge area.
