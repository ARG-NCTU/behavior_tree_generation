Imagine you are helping me interact with the Gazebo simulator for drones. At any given point of time, you have the following abilities. 
There are two turbines, some solar panels and a car in the world.

The simulator contains a drone, along with several objects. Apart from the drone, none of the objects are movable. 

The following subtrees are available. You are not to use any other hypothetical functions.And not all subtrees are suitable and necessary, you need to evaluate and choose the subtrees you need.

Subtrees:
"object_in_view": This behavior tree will return true when there is desired object in sight. 
"object_not_in_view": This behavior tree will return true when there is no object in sight.
"reset_drone": When this subtree is triggered, reset the preflight state that need to reset before takeoff.
"waypoint_takeoff": When this subtree is triggered, takeoff to the air.
"waypoint_landing": When this subtree is triggered, land to the ground immediately.
"waypoint_tracking": When this subtree is triggered, move toward the target object position when the target object is inside the camera view.
"linear_x_control": When this subtree is triggered, try to minimize the absolute(drone_x - object_x) when the target object is inside the camera view.
"linear_y_control": When this subtree is triggered, try to minimize the absolute(drone_y - object_y) when the target object is inside the camera view.
"linear_z_control": When this subtree is triggered, try to minimize the absolute(drone_z - object_z) when the target object is inside the camera view.
"report_error": When this subtree is triggered, report current distance (distance = (drone_x - object_X)^2 + (drone_y - object_y)^2 + (drone_z - object_z)^2)^0.5) , and the supervisor will evaulate the performance according to this distance.
"explore_forward": When this subtree is triggered, move forward a static distance.
"explore_right": When this subtree is triggered, Rotate 90 degree to right side and raise the flag. If the flag is not been reset, this subtree will not been triggered.
"explore_left": When this subtree is triggered, Rotate 90 degree to left side and raise the flag. If the flag is not been reset, this subtree will not been triggered.
"explore_rotate": When this subtree is triggered, rotate to left side and right side one time and raise the flag. If the flag is not been reset, this subtree will not been triggered.
"explore_patter_block": When this subtree is triggered, follow the pattern block pattern to explore a huge area.

And here are the example source tasks in behavior tree architecture:


Task: change wheel for a car
Procedure:{
    Do phase 1:{
        Do phase 1-1:{
            "put_car_at_conveyor"
        }Do phase 1-2 if 1-1 success:{
            "lift_car"
        }
    }Do phase 2 if 1 success:{
        Do phase 2-1:{
            "pick_wheel"
        }Do phase 2-2 if 2-1 success:{
            "approach_conveyor"
        }
    }Do phase 3 if 2 success:{
        Do phase 3-1 at the same time:{
            "align_wheel_in_x_axis"
            "align_wheel_in_y_axis"
        }
    }Do phase 4 if 3 success:{
        Do phase 4-1:{
            "insert_screws"
        }Do phase 4-2 if 4-1 success:{
            "fasten_screws"
        }
    }Do phase 5 if 4 success:{
        Do phase 5-1:{
            "leave_conveyor"
        }
    }
}

Task: Take off and fly to the desired destination. After reach the destination, go home.
Procedure:{
    Do phase 1:{
        Do phase 1-1:{
            "already_visited_destination"
        }Do phase 1-2 if 1-1 success:{
            "already_at_home"
        }Do phase 1-3 if 1-2 success:{
            "land"
        }
    }Do phase 2 if 1 failed:{
        Do phase 2-1:{
            Do phase 2-1-1:{
                "already_in_the_air"
            }Do phase 2-1-2 if 2-1-1 success:{
                "takeoff"
            }
        }Do phase 2-2 if 2-1 success:{
            Do phase 2-2-1:{
                "already_visited_destination"
            }Do phase 2-2-2 if 2-2-1 success:{
                "go_to_destination"
            }
        }Do phase 2-3 if 2-2 success:{
            Do phase 2-3-1:{
                "already_at_home"
            }Do phase 2-3-2 if 2-3-1 success:{
                "go_home"
            }
        }
    } 
}



Now you already in the air, don't need to takeoff. And the ball is aleady in your view, don't need any exloration behaviors. Please executes a visual servoing approach towards the ball.

Please design this task as behavior tree. You can follow the example source tasks.
